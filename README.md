# RMPicoPortalGun
Repo for my Pico portal gun from Rick and Morty

Updated to use both cores of Pico for simultaneous loops, allowing for a constant animation of the plasma tube and operation of the dial/button at the same time.

I used blue tack because I'm lazy. Internet says it's non conductive so should be alright.

I used copper tape to create a cartridge like system so you can just slide the tray in and out for charging. Detachable wires also work (thats what I used in my first version, it was just annoying to stuff the wires in each time)

Inside the case, I placed copper tape, then soldered the wires onto it while it was inside. This was difficult, but doable. Good luck!
